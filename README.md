# Word-Guess-Game

This is a project game developed as practice for learning Javascript. It contains basic functions, for loops, if/else statements, and other important aspects of Javascript

The game functions as a hangman-type game, where a word is picked at random by the computer and the user guesses by typing in letters. The game records letters guessed, number of guesses left, and wins. There is an alert that pops up in the event of a win or loss. 

Users can get started by simply clicking the "Start" button, at which point a word will be picked by the computer at random and displayed on the screen in the form of hyphens. As the user presses a key, letters will be recorded and, if correct, will reveal characters in the word until the user wins or loses, depending on if they guessed all the letters correctly, or ran out of guesses.

If the user wishes to continue playing after a win or lose, they can click the start button and a new word will be generated and any wins will continue to be recorded.
